👋 Welcome! I’m a seasoned **Cybersecurity Engineer** with over a decade of experience in the field. My journey has been driven by a philosophy that *"anything can be scripted, automated, and debugged."* This mindset has led me to develop a diverse skill set across multiple domains within cybersecurity, where I specialize in creating efficient, reliable, and secure systems.

## Key Skills & Expertise

💻 **Programming & Scripting**: I’m fluent in several programming languages, including **Python, C, C++, PowerShell**, and **JavaScript**. My ability to code has empowered me to automate complex processes and build tools that streamline threat detection and response.

🔐 **Security Analysis & Threat Detection**: I have deep expertise in **malware analysis, reverse engineering**, and **exploit analysis**. Whether it’s analyzing malware behaviors, crafting YARA and Sigma rules for threat detection, or using tools like IDA Pro and Ghidra for in-depth analysis, I’m well-versed in understanding and combating advanced threats.

🔍 **Threat Intelligence & Hunting**: Proficient in **Threat Hunting**, **Log Analysis**, and utilizing frameworks like the **Cyber Kill Chain**, I’m adept at analyzing TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). This expertise helps me stay ahead of adversaries and improve defensive measures.

🚀 **Automation & Tool Development**: My belief in automation has driven me to design and implement tools that enhance the efficiency of security operations. I’m skilled in **REST API Development**, using **Docker** for containerization, and building robust systems that integrate seamlessly with SOC workflows.

📊 **Data Analytics & SIEM Management**: With a strong command of **SIEMs** (like Splunk and ElasticSearch) and **SOARs**, I excel in big data analytics for security, from threat detection to incident response. My knowledge in **SQL, NoSQL**, and **Microsoft KQL** further allows me to extract meaningful insights from large datasets, which is crucial for threat analysis.

🌐 **Cloud & Infrastructure Security**: Experienced with **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Azure**, I ensure that security is baked into every part of an organization’s infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud. My expertise includes vulnerability analysis, penetration testing, and secure infrastructure design.

With a passion for continuous learning and a love for sharing knowledge, I’m here to make a meaningful impact in the cybersecurity community. Thank you for visiting my blog—feel free to connect if you share an interest in making the digital world a safer place!
